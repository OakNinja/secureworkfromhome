                            Set up a guest Wi-Fi network and use that for your work computer. Most fairly modern routers have support for a second WiFi network for guests. 
                            Guests can not communicate with other devices in your home, and your home devices can not communicate with them. 
                            This protects your work computer from potentially infected devices in your home. <a href="/router-config.html">Here's</a> instructions on how to set up a guest network.
